nG-SetEnvIf was created as a fork of the [nG Firewall](https://perishablepress.com/ng-firewall/) that replicates its functionality in Apache httpd using `mod_setenvif` and tracks upstream release. The trade-off is between the [efficiency gained](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/avoid.html) over `mod_rewrite` and [having to defer](https://www.webmasterworld.com/apache/4572958.htm) to any existing rewrite rules (_eg_ for [permalink settings](https://github.com/t18d/nG-SetEnvIf/wiki/Recipes#disable-mod_rewrite)).

The focus being on performance, no logging facility is provided in addition to httpd's native logs. Backreference support has been removed to minimise memory footprint.

&nbsp;  
> [!NOTE]
> httpd's default behaviour (_eg_ [MergeSlashes](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#mergeslashes)) overrides certain rules.

> [!WARNING]
> [Test with mod_rewrite](https://perishablepress.com/ng-firewall-logging/) before deploying nG-SetEnvIf.
